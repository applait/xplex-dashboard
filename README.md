# xplex dashboard

> The web application frontend for xplex users

## developing
To get set up, run:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:applait/xplex-dashboard.git
cd xplex-dashboard
npm install
```
If all went well, you're all set to play around with the code. At this point, the next viable step would be to run any of these commands according to your purpose:

```bash
# run a development server at http://localhost:8080/
npm run serve

# build the production version of the app into `./dist`
npm run build

# you may as well use these commands for obvious reasons
# although, they're not yet fully functional/implemented
npm run lint
npm run test
```

## contributing
Use specific [commit message convention](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer/blob/master/lib/default-release-rules.js) to go well with semantic-release. Until we settle on a specific convention, use Angular convention as a safe default.
